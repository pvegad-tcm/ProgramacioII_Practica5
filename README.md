# A Breakout VideoGame
## A C# University Practical Exercice

#### This code is part of a practical exercise done at the university in May 2017. Implements the [SFML library](https://sfml-dev.org).

As you will see, this is a messy code made by a first-year student of a Videogame Development Degree. Its usefulness is to show the implementation of the aforementioned library, as well as observe the layer that separates the student's code from the teacher's code.
